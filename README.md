<p align="left"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-FINISHED-red"></p>
<h2>General Description</h2>
<p>
This is a basic 2D side-scrolling car game. While playing, you can expect an infinite run implemented by recycling layers as the player moves. Additionally, there are a few props (clouds and bushes) that are procedurally generated in the scene.
</p>
<h2>Mechanics</h2>
<p>
This is a very simple game, so there are only three mechanics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving forward by pressing either the <b>D</b> key or the <b>Right arrow</b>.</li>
<li>Opening the inventory by pressing the <b>ESC</b> key.</li>
<li>"Consuming" an item from the inventory by clicking on it. When the item is consumed, it will dissapear from the inventory and a message will be displayed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assets</h2>
For the car sprites, I downloaded it in the Unity Asset Store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/2d-car-73763.</br>
The rest of the sprites has been created by me.
