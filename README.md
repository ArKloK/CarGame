<h2>General Description</h2>
<p>
This is a basic 2D side-scrolling car game. While playing, you can expect an infinite run implemented by recycling layers as the player moves. Additionally, there are a few props (clouds and bushes) that are procedurally generated in the scene.
</p>
<h2>Mechanics</h2>
<p>
This is a very simple game, so there are only three mechanics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving forward by pressing either the <b>D</b> key or the <b>Right arrow</b>.</li>
<li>Opening the inventory by pressing the <b>ESC</b> key.</li>
<li>"Consuming" an item from the inventory by clicking on it.</li>
</ul>
